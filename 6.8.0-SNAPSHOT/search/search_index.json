Synopsys Detect uploads the identities of those components to Black Duck. Black Duck utilizes this information to build an open source software Bill Of Materials (BOM) for your project, and identify any associated security vulnerabilities and software licenses. Synopsys Detect discovers components using a variety of detection methods, including: Package manager inspection utilizing commonly used tools such as Maven, Gradle, etc. File scanning utilizing the Black Duck Signature Scanner. Docker image inspection utilizing the Black Duck Docker Inspector. Binary file analysis utilizing Black Duck - Binary Analysis. By combining all these techniques Synopsys Detect is capable of scanning a wide range of software projects utilizing a variety of package managers and programming languages for open source components that are registered within the Black Duck KnowledgeBase. Synopsys Detect runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. It is available through GitHub, under a permissive Apache license and does not require pre-installation or configuration. For more information, refer to Requirements . Although Synopsys Detect can support large projects, care should be taken to ensure that scans are performed to optimize platform performance and produce manageable and meaningful results. For applications containing multiple sub-projects, it may be advantageous to scan sub-projects separately and combine results as a project of projects, or other techniques. A typical Synopsys Detect run # While there are many variations on a Synopsys Detect run, a typical Synopsys Detect run performs the steps described as follows. In this example, the user has provided Black Duck connection details through property settings to Synopsys Detect, signalling that results (project dependency details) are to be uploaded to Black Duck. In a typical run, Synopsys Detect: Uses the project's package manager to derive the hierarchy of dependencies known to that package manager. For example, on a Maven project, Synopsys Detect executes an \"mvn dependency:tree\" command, and derives dependency information from the output. Runs the Black Duck Signature Scanner on the project. This may identify additional dependencies not known to the package manager (for example, a .jar file copied into the project directory). Uploads both sets of results (dependency details) to Black Duck creating the project/version if it does not already exist. Black Duck uses the uploaded dependency information to build the Bill Of Materials (BOM) for the project/version. Synopsys Detect processing in more detail # Synopsys Detect processing is divided into three phases: Initialization Run Cleanup Initialization phase # During the initialization phase, Synopsys Detect performs verification checks on the user-provided configration, checks to see if it can connect to any external systems needed for the run, and creates any required directories. Run phase # During the run phase, Synopsys Detect processes an ordered list of tools , invoking all that apply. Tool applicability depends on how Synopsys Detect is configured; in other words, the property values you set. The detector tool runs by default. The Black Duck Signature Scanner tool runs by default when Black Duck connection details are provided. The detector tool invokes all applicable detectors . Detector applicability depends on what Synopsys Detect finds in your project. For example, if Synopsys Detect finds a pom.xml file, it runs the Maven detector. If it finds Gradle files, it runs the Gradle detector. In the typical run previously described, two tools are applied: the detector tool which ran the Maven detector, and the Black Duck Signature Scanner tool which ran the Black Duck Signature Scanner. At the end of the run phase, Synopsys Detect uploads results to the appropriate external system(s) (Black Duck and/or Polaris), and optionally perform post actions, such as generating a risk report or checking for policy violations. In the typical run previously described, Synopsys Detect uploads Black Duck results from the Maven detector and the Black Duck Signature Scanner.

Step 1: Locate or acquire a source code project on which you will run Synopsys Detect. # To run Synopsys Detect on junit4, which is an open source project written in Java and built with Maven, you could acquire it by doing the following: git clone https://github.com/junit-team/junit4.git cd junit4 To understand what Synopsys Detect does, it can be helpful to think about what you would do if you wanted to discover this project's dependencies without using Synopsys Detect. You might do the following: Look in the project directory (junit4) for hints about how dependencies are managed. In this case, the mvnw and pom.xml files are hints that dependencies are managed using Maven. Since it's a Maven project, you would likely run ./mvnw dependency:tree to reveal the project's dependencies; both direct and transitive. This is exactly what Synopsys Detect does on this project. In addition, Synopsys Detect runs the Black Duck Signature Scanner on the directory, which discovers additional dependencies added to the project by any means other than the package manager. Step 2: Run Synopsys Detect in offline mode. # Running Synopsys Detect in offline mode eliminates the need to provide connection details to Black Duck or Polaris, while giving you an opportunity to see what Synopsys Detect does on a project. At the top level of the project directory (junit4), run Synopsys Detect in offline mode. On Linux or Mac: bash (curl -s -L https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.sh) --blackduck.offline.mode=true On Windows: powershell [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 'tls12'; irm https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.ps1?$(Get-Random) | iex; detect --blackduck.offline.mode=true The operations performed by Synopsys Detect depends on what it finds in your source directory. By default, Synopsys Detect considers the current working directory to be your source directory. In the junit4 case, Synopsys Detect will: Run the Maven detector, creating one BDIO (Black Duck Input Output) (.jsonld) file that contains the dependencies discovered using Maven. Run the Black Duck Signature Scanner, creating a .json file that contains the dependencies discovered by the Black Duck Signature Scanner. In offline mode, neither of these are uploaded to Black Duck. To locate these files, look in the log for the message \"Run directory: ...\". These files are located inside the specified run directory. Step 3: Run Synopsys Detect connected to Black Duck. # If you have access to a Black Duck server, you can re-run Synopsys Detect, this time connecting and uploading results to Black Duck. To connect Synopsys Detect to Black Duck, replace the --blackduck.offline.mode=true command line argument with the following three arguments that provide login details for your Black Duck server: --blackduck.url={your Black Duck server URL} --blackduck.username={your Black Duck username} --blackduck.password={your Black Duck password} The command you run looks like this: On Linux or Mac: bash (curl -s -L https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.sh) --blackduck.url={your Black Duck server URL} --blackduck.username={your Black Duck username} --blackduck.password={your Black Duck password} On Windows: powershell [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 'tls12'; irm https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.ps1?$(Get-Random) | iex; detect --blackduck.url={your Black Duck server URL} --blackduck.username={your Black Duck username} --blackduck.password={your Black Duck password} In this way, Synopsys Detect performs the same steps it did in the offline run, plus the following: Uploads the discovered dependencies to Black Duck.

Running with Black Duck # Synopsys Detect can be used with Black Duck to perform Software Composition Analysis (SCA). Overview # When Black Duck connection details are provided, Synopsys Detect executes the following by default: The detector tool , which runs the appropriate package manager-specific detector; the Maven detector for Maven projects, the Gradle detector for Gradle projects, and so forth. The Black Duck Signature Scanner , which performs a Black Duck signature scan on the project directory. Synopsys Detect can be configured to perform additional tasks, including the following: Enable any of the supported snippet matching modes in the Black Duck Signature Scanner . Enable the Vulnerability Impact Analysis Tool on any Java project. Run Black Duck - Binary Analysis on a given binary files. Run the Black Duck Docker Inspector on a given Docker image . Generate a report . Fail on policy violation . Refer to Black Duck Server properties and Black Duck Signature Scanner properties for details. Offline mode # If you do not have a Black Duck instance, or if your network is down, you can still run Synopsys Detect in offline mode. In offline mode, Synopsys Detect creates the BDIO content and the dry run Black Duck signature scan output files without attempting to upload them to Black Duck. You can run Synopsys Detect in offline mode using the offline mode property . BDIO format # Synopsys Detect produces dependency information for Black Duck in Black Duck Input Output (BDIO) format files. Synopsys Detect can produce BDIO files in two formats: BDIO version 1, or BDIO version 2. Versions of Black Duck prior to 2018.12.4 accept only BDIO 1.

The CLANG detector collects any dependency files not recognized by the Linux package manager that reside outside the source directory (the directory containing the compile_commands.json file), and writes them to the status.json file. Added the property detect.blackduck.signature.scanner.copyright.search . Removed PipEnv from the list of buildless detectors as it was never buildless. Improved output for signature scanner status, and included descriptions for exit codes when reporting overall status. Status.json file now collects code location data generated by all tools, not just detectors. Status.json file now collects issue data generated by all tools. Resolved issues # (IDETECT-2019) Resolved an issue where the pip inspector would not be able to parse the requirements.txt file if pip's version was = 20.1. (IDETECT-2034) Resolved an issue that would cause a NullPointerException when Synopsys Detect's initial attempt at generating a code location name produced a code location name greater than 250 characters and either code location prefix or code location suffix is not set.

Known Issues # When a Lerna package depends on another Lerna package within the project, an error may appear indicating a missing dependency on that package. This is normal and no dependencies are missing. This will be fixed in a future release. Version 6.3.0 # New features # The Yarn detector now extracts project information from package.json files. Git is no longer the default supplier of project information for Yarn projects. Added Yarn Detector support for dependencies that are missing a fuzzy version in a lockfile dependency declaration. Synopsys Detect logs policy violations when it is configured to fail on policy violations . Changed features # Users can upload source files when license search is enabled regardless of whether snippet matching has been enabled. Synopsys Detect is now compatible with Yocto 3.0. Synopsys Detect stops if the Docker Inspector tool applies and Synopsys Detect is running on Windows. Synopsys Detect configures Docker Inspector's working directories inside Synopsys Detect's run directory. Synopsys Detect requires and runs Docker Inspector version 9. Moved the location to which detect.sh downloads the Synopsys Detect .jar from /tmp to ~/synopsys-detect/download. Resolved issues # (IDETECT-1906) Resolved an issue wherein git extraction might fail if \"git log\" returned unexpected output. As a last resort, the commit hash will be used as a version. (IDETECT-1883) Resolved an issue where Synopsys Detect failed to extract project information when parsing a Git repository with a detached head while in buildless mode. (IDETECT-1970) Resolved an issue where the default value for parallel processors was not used. The available runtime processor count was being used instead. (IDETECT-1973) Resolved an issue where the NuGet exe inspector would not resolve from Artifactory. (IDETECT-1965) Resolved an issue where Synopsys Detect would fail to resolve environment variables where it did so previously.

Version 6.2.1 # Resolved issues # Resolved an issue wherein an exception was thrown when generating a risk report if users didn't set the risk report output path explicitly. (IDETECT-1960) Version 6.2.0 # New features # The Synopsys Detect .jar file is now signed, enabling code verification by users. Simple proxy information will be forwarded to the Gradle Inspector. Detect now creates a status file describing the results of the run which includes things like issues, results and status codes. The property configuration table in the log now includes the origin of the property's value. Added the property detect.blackduck.signature.scanner.license.search . Added the property detect.blackduck.signature.scanner.individual.file.matching . If an executable returns a nonzero exit code, Detect will now log the executable output automatically. Added page for deprecated properties in help. Detect-generated risk reports now feature Synopsys logo and branding. Changed features # The PipEnv Detector now parses a json representation of the dependency tree. Powershell download speed increased. Resolved issues # Resolved an issue where the download URL for Synopsys Detect was being set to an internal URL upon release (IDETECT-1847). Resolved an issue where all transitive dependencies found by the Pip inspector were being reported as direct dependencies (IDETECT-1893). Resolved an issue where using pip version 20+ with the Pip inspector caused a failure to import a dependency. GitHub PR (IDETECT-1868) Resolved the following vulnerabilities (IDETECT-1872): org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter 5.1.7.RELEASE BDSA-2020-0069 (CVE-2020-5398) Resolved an issue where Synopsys Detect had the potential to fail on projects that utilized Yarn workspaces (IDETECT-1916). Note: Yarn workspaces are not currently supported. See yarn workspace support . Resolved an issue in the Bazel Detector that caused it to fail for the maven_install rule when the tags field contained multiple tags with a mixture of formats (IDETECT-1925). When parsing package.xml files, Detect will no longer raise a SAXParseException when the file contains a doctype declaration, and will continue parsing the rest of the file (IDETECT-1866). Resolved an issue that could cause generation of an invalid Black Duck Input/Output (BDIO) file when the only differences between two component names/versions are non-alphanumeric characters (IDETECT-1856). Version 6.1.0 # New features # Added the property detect.bdio2.enabled . Added the property detect.pip.only.project.tree . Added the property detect.bitbake.search.depth . Added the property detect.bazel.cquery.options . Added the property detect.docker.image.id . Added the property detect.docker.platform.top.layer.id . Added the property detect.bom.aggregate.remediation.mode Changed features # Deprecated all Polaris-related properties. Added wildcard support for several include/exclude list properties. Improved the structure of the dependency information produced by the Yarn detector by changing its approach. It now parses dependency information from yarn.lock and package.json, instead of running the yarn command. Since the yarn command is no longer executed, the detect.yarn.path property has been removed. Improved match accuracy for Bitbake projects by improving external ID generation for dependencies referenced using Git protocols, and dependencies referenced with an epoch and/or revision. Improved the reliability of the Bitbake detector by generating recipe-depends.dot and package-depends.dot files the source directory, instead of a temporary directory. Changed the logging level of Polaris CLI output from DEBUG to INFO. Added support for the Noto-CJK font (for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text) in the risk report. Resolved issues # Resolved an issue that can cause a Null Pointer Exception on Maven projects configured for multi-threaded builds. Resolved an issue that can cause Detect to fail due to an expired Black Duck bearer token. Resolved an issue that causes Detect to fail when a parent project and version are specified, and the project is already a child of the specified parent. Resolved an issue that causes Detect to log the git username and password when a git command executed by Detect fails. Resolved an issue that can cause Detect to generate a new code location (scan) when the character case of the value of the detect.source.path property differs from a previous run on the same project. Resolved the following vulnerabilities: commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils 1.9.3 / BDSA-2014-0129 (CVE-2019-10086), org.apache.commons:commons-compress 1.18 / BDSA-2019-2725 (CVE-2019-12402) Version 6.0.0 # New features # Added the property detect.binary.scan.file.name.patterns. Added the property detect.detector.search.exclusion.files which accepts a comma-separated list of file names to exclude from the Detector search. Custom arguments for the source command can now be supplied to Detect through the property detect.bitbake.source.arguments which accepts a comma-separated list of arguments. (1614) Added support for the Swift package manager. Added support for GoGradle. Added support for Go Modules. The property detect.pip.requirements.path is now a comma-separated list of paths to requirements.txt files. This enables you to specify multiple requirements files. Each requirements file displays as a new code location in Black Duck. Detect now logs username, roles, and groups for the current user. Detect now includes the project name/version in every code location name. Detect now takes in a go path, but does not take in go.dep.path; nor does Detect trigger on *.go. The property detect.parallel.processors is added. This property controls the number of parallel threads, and replaces the properties detect.blackduck.signature.scanner.parallel.processors and detect.hub.signature.scanner.parallel.processors. Added the property detect.maven.included.scopes. This is a comma-separated list of Maven scopes. Output is limited to dependencies within these scopes, and is overridden by exclude. Added the property detect.maven.excluded.scopes. This is a comma-separated list of Maven scopes. Output is limited to dependencies outside these scopes, and is overridden by include. Bazel detector: added support for dependencies specified using the maven_install workspace rule. The detect.bazel.advanced.rules.path property is removed. When using Detect for static analysis, you can pass the build command to let the Polaris CLI know how to analyze a given project. Changed features # Architecture is no longer included in BitBake dependencies discovered by Detect. The property detect.bitbake.reference.impl is no longer used and is deprecated. The BitBake detector no longer uses the property detect.bitbake.reference.impl because architecture is no longer required to match with artifacts in the KnowledgeBase. The Bitbake detector now attempts to determine the layer in which a component originated instead of the architecture. Improved the Detect on-screen logging to be more concise. The PiP inspector is no longer deprecated, and is currently supported. When creating an air gap zip of Detect using the switch -z or --zip, the created zip file is now published to your output directory. Scripts no longer fail if the Artifactory server is unavailable. Enhanced placement and formatting of deprecation logs. Added support for Java version 11. The following properties are removed in Detect version 6.0.0: detect.go.dep.path detect.npm.node.path detect.perl.path detect.go.run.dep.init detect.maven.scope detect.bazel.advanced.rules.path Resolved issues # Resolved an issue wherein the Windows Java path construction did not account for direction of the slash. The shell script now uses the correct slash direction, based on the operating system on which Detect is running. Resolved an issue wherein Detect was not finding the file recipe-depends.dot written to the current directory. Detect now looks in the source directory to a depth of 1 if it cannot find the expected files in the expected location. Resolved an issue wherein Detect was failing if it could not resolve placeholders. Resolved an issue wherein Detect was not handling SSH URLs, which caused Detect to fail in extracting project information from the Git executable. GitCliDetectable now properly handles SSH URLs. Resolved an issue wherein the Detect JAR was downloading for each scan when the script could not communicate with Artifactory. Now, if the script cannot communicate with Artifactory, and there is an existing downloaded Detect, then the previously-downloaded version of Detect runs. However, if you provided a DETECT_LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION and Detect cannot communicate with Artifactory, Detect will not run. Resolved an issue wherein Detect was not properly parsing GIT URLs such as git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git. Version 5.6.2 # Resolved issues # Synopsys Detect version 5.6.2 is a rebuild of version 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 to address an issue with the binary repository to which it was published. Version 5.6.0 # New features # You can now set custom fields on created Black Duck projects. Detect can now generate its own air gap zip. Detectors now nest by default. Added support for Gradle Kotlin. Added support for wildcard (*) in the Detect flag blackduck.proxy.ignored.hosts. Added support for --detect.project.tags. Added the properties --detect.parent.project.name and --detect.parent.project.version.name. Added the property --detect.clone.project.version.latest=true which takes precedence over the exact version name. Added support for Yocto 2.0.0. Added support to parse components from the plugins block in pom.xml. This only works when detect.detector.buildless=true. Added capability to represent '' and \"\" as a null value in Detect multiselect custom fields. Changed features # You can now specify the search depth for buildless mode. Updated the help menu and provided more detailed help options. Diagnostics now includes signature scanner log files. Re-enabled empty aggregate file generation. Polaris no longer runs the the -w switch enabled by default. To retrieve the issue/policy count, you can use the -w switch. Match accuracy for Docker images is improved by running the signature scanner on a squashed version of the Docker image instead of the container file system. This results in a different name for the code location because the name of the file being scanned is different. For existing projects, the old code location named by default as repo _ tag _containerfilesystem.tar.gz/ repo / tag scan must be removed to ensure it does not contribute stale data to the BOM. Due to the new method of scanning, the code location name has changed. You must remove the old code location in favor of the new code location. Resolved issues # Resolved an issue that could cause code location names to contain relative file paths when the value of detect.source.path uses symbolic links to specify the source directory. Resolved an issue that caused detect.sh to fail when Java is not on the system path, and the JAVA_HOME path contains a space. Resolved an issue wherein the signature scanner may not have been reporting failures correctly. Resolved an issue wherein Detect was not locating the file recipe-depends.dot when it was written to the current directory. Detect now searches for the recipe-depends.dot file to a depth of 1 when extracting on a BitBake project. Detect no longer fails if the Git executable is not found. Resolved an issue wherein Detect may fail when the directory pointed to by --detect.notices.report.path does not exist. Version 5.5.1 # Resolved issues # Resolved an issue wherein the Pipenv detector was omitting project dependencies. Version 5.5.0 # New features # Added support for snippet modes. The property detect.wait.for.results is been added to wait for Black Duck. The default value is false. If this property is set to true, Detect won't complete until the normal timeout is reached or the underlying systems with which Detect is communicating are once again idle and ready to receive more data. The timeout value is controlled by blackduck.timeout. The shell script and PowerShell script now accept DETECT_JAVA_PATH and DETECT_JAVA_HOME as environment variables for pointing to your Java installation. Added a new property --detect.detector.search.exclusion.paths. A comma-separated list of directory paths to exclude from a detector search. For example, foo/bar/biz only excludes the biz directory if the parent directory structure is 'foo/bar/'. Detect now uses Git information to determine the default project and version names. There is a new Detect property for overriding the Git executable: detect.git.path. Resolved issues # Resolved an issue that caused the risk report to be generated with invalid links to Black Duck components. Resolved an issue that caused a null pointer exception error when a golang's Gopkg.lock file contained zero projects. Resolved an issue wherein the Clang detector could omit the epoch from the version string in RPM packages. Resolved an issue wherein with two users running Detect on a single system may result in a Permission denied error. Resolved an issue wherein the property -detect.policy.check.fail.on.severities may not be waiting for the snippet scans to complete. Resolved an issue wherein the property --detect.blackduck.signature.scanner.exclusion.name.patterns may not be following the paths. Resolved an issue wherein Detect may fail when the directory specified by --detect.risk.report.pdf.path did not exist. Detect now attempts to create the directory structure to the specified path. A warning is logged if Detect fails to create the directory. Resolved an issue wherein properties that had a primary group and additional property group may have been excluded from the group search. Resolved an issue wherein the deprecation warning displayed when the deprecated property was provided by the user. Resolved an issue with aggregate BOM filename generation that could cause the message Unable to relativize path, full source path will be used to display in the log. Resolved an issue that could cause components to be omitted from the BOM for Conda projects. Resolved an issue that could cause errors during parsing of Maven projects with long sub-project names. Changed features # The default value for the property detect.docker.path.required is now false. The ALL logging level is replaced with the TRACE logging level. The results URL for the Black Duck project BOM is now moved to the Detect Results panel. Renamed Detect Results to Detect Status. Previously, a temp file remained which could contain plain-text user name or password information. This temp file is now removed. Bazel is added as an acceptable value to the detect.tools properties. Detect now uses the current version of Docker Inspector. This means that no matter what version of Docker Inspector is currently released, Detect now uses that version. Version 5.4.0 # New features # Added buildless mode. Added a new property for BitBake to remove Yocto reference implementation characters. Added a new property for adding group names to projects. Added a new property for uploading source files. Added the additional_components placeholder. Resolved issues # Resolved an issue wherein Yarn may have been incorrectly calculating the tree level. Resolved an issue wherein Detect may fail when Polaris is excluded, a Polaris URL is provided, and connection to Polaris failed. Resolved an issue that caused Detect to follow symbolic links while searching directories for files. Resolved an issue wherein Detect was not failing policy for UNSPECIFIED when fail on severities is set to ALL. Resolved an issue that could cause a counter (an integer intended to ensure uniqueness), to be unnecessarily appended to a code location name. Resolved an issue that may have caused the package manager name to be excluded from the code location name when a code location name was provided. Resolved an issue that could cause Detect to continue after a Polaris connection failure. Resolved an issue wherein the Detect scan results may incorrectly show development dependencies. Resolved an issue that could cause reports to fail due to timeout intermittently. Resolved an issue that could cause the value of --polaris.access.token to be logged to the console when detect.sh is invoked. Resolved an issue wherein Detect was cleaning up the contents but not the directory of the run. Changed features # For getting all logs, the ALL logging level is now TRACE. Improved the error message logged when the property detect.binary.scan.file.path, which must point to a readable file, points to something other than a readable file, such as a directory. Changed the environment variable used to tell the Detect scripts where to download the Detect jar. The previous value DETECT_JAR_PATH is now changed to DETECT_JAR_DOWNLOAD_DIR. Improved the parsing of packrat.lock files to better represent the relationships between dependencies in the graph. The version of Detect is no longer part of the code location name. Version 5.3.3 # Resolved an issue wherein reports for projects containing risks may be generated with a status of zero risks shown. Version 5.3.2 # Synopsys Detect version 5.3.2 is a minor maintenance release. Version 5.3.1 # New features # Added new property detect.ignore.connection.failures which enables Synopsys Detect to continue even if it fails to talk to Black Duck. Resolved issues # Resolved an issue wherein build scan failures may occur in TFS with the error [COPY Operation] noSuchPath in source, path provided: //license/ownership. Resolved an issue wherein if the property detect.clone.project.version.name is set to a non-existent project version, the log messages are now improved to make it easier to recognize the problem. Changed features # In cases where the property detect.clone.project.version.name is set to a non-existent project version, the log messages are now improved to make it easier to recognize the issue. Version 5.2.0 # New features # Added support for Bazel. Added support for CMake. Added a property to support using project version nicknames. Added a property for application ID. Added Java wildcard pattern support. Added support for Coverity on Polaris. Resolved issues # Resolved an issue wherein the package-lock.json file may be missing additional versions. Resolved an issue wherein multiple simultaneous Detect executions may cause BDIO merges. Resolved an issue wherein permission errors may display when creating projects or scanning. Changed features # The --detect.bom.aggregate.name property now checks for an empty BOM. If the BOM is empty, it is not uploaded to Black Duck. Added support for PiP versions 6.0.0 and higher. Improved error messages for Black Duck connection issues. Cosmetic changes: from Black Duck Detect to Synopsys Detect. Streamlined execution of Coverity and Black Duck scans through a single continuous integration job. Updated location of the shell/PowerShell scripts. Updated location of the air-gapped archive. Version 5.1.0 # New features # Added support for GoVendor. Added executable output to diagnostic mode. Added the project/version GUID in the console output. Added error codes. Resolved issues # Resolved an issue that fixes the Clang Detector (for C/C++) handling of complex quoted strings occurring in compiler commands found in the JSON compilation database (compile_commands.json) file. Resolved an issue wherein a Null Pointer Exception error may occur when Detect cannot access a file during signature scan exclusion calculating. Resolved an issue wherein the RubyGems package manager had missing components. Resolved an issue wherein the NPM package lock added every dependency as a root dependency. Changed features # The properties --detect.nuget.path and --detect.nuget.inspector.name are deprecated. The properties detect.suppress.results.output and detect.suppress.configuration.output are deprecated. The output from these properties is logged instead of written to sysout. Improved the reporting of scan registration limit errors. Version 5.0.1 # Resolved issues # Resolved an issue wherein a null pointer exception error may occur in the NuGet portion of a scan when running Synopsys Detect in Linux.

For simple use cases, add either --detect.docker.image={repo}:{tag} or --detect.docker.tar={path to a Docker saved tarfile} to the Synopsys Detect command line. The documentation for Docker Inspector is available here . When passed a value for either detect.docker.image or detect.docker.tar, Synopsys Detect runs Docker Inspector on given image (the \"target image\"), creating one code location. Synopsys Detect by default runs the Black Duck Signature Scanner on the \"container file system\" (the file system a container created from the image has at startup time). Refer to Synopsys Detect's scan target for more details. This creates a second code location. Passing Docker Inspector property values to Docker Inspector from Synopsys Detect # For more complex use cases, you may need to pass Docker Inspector property values to Docker Inspector using Synopsys Detect. To do this, construct the Synopsys Detect property name by prefixing the Docker Inspector property name with detect.docker.passthrough. . For example, suppose you need to set Docker Inspector's service.timeout value (the length of time Docker Inspector waits for a response from the Image Inspector services that it uses) to 480000 milliseconds. You add the prefix to the Docker Inspector property name to derive the Synopsys Detect property name detect.docker.passthrough.service.timeout . Therefore, add --detect.docker.passthrough.service.timeout=480000 to the Synopsys Detect command line. For example: ./detect.sh --detect.docker.image=ubuntu:latest --detect.docker.passthrough.service.timeout=480000 You can set any Docker Inspector property using this method. However, you usually should not override the values of the following Docker Inspector properties (which Synopsys Detect sets) because changing their values is likely to interfere with Synopsys Detect's ability to work with Docker Inspector: output.path output.include.squashedimage output.include.containerfilesystem upload.bdio Synopsys Detect's scan target # When a Docker image is run; for example, using a docker run command, a container is created. That container has a file system; in other words, the container file system. The container file system at the instant the container is created; in other words, the initial container file system, can be determined in advance from the image without running the image. Because the target image is not yet trusted, Docker Inspector does not run the image; that is, it does not create a container from the image, but it does construct the initial container file system, which is the file system a container has at the instant it is created. When Synopsys Detect invokes both Docker Inspector because either detect.docker.image or detect.docker.tar is set, and the Black Duck Signature Scanner, as it does by default, the target of that Black Duck signature scan is the initial container file system constructed by Docker Inspector, packaged in a way to optimize results from Black Duck's matching algorithms. Rather than directly running the Black Duck Signature Scanner on the initial container file system, Synopsys Detect runs the Black Duck Signature Scanner on a new image; in other words, the squashed image, constructed using the initial container file system built by Docker Inspector. Packaging the initial container file system in a Docker image triggers matching algorithms within Black Duck that optimize match results for Linux file systems. In earlier versions of Synopsys Detect / Docker Inspector, Synopsys Detect ran the Black Duck Signature Scanner directly on the target image. This approach had the disadvantage of potentially producing false positives under certain circumstances. For example, suppose your target image consists of multiple layers. If version 1 of a package is installed in layer 0, and then replaced with a newer version of that package in layer 1, both versions exist in the image, even though the initial container file system only includes version 2. A Black Duck signature scan of the target image shows both versions, even though version 1 has been effectively replaced with version 2. The current Synopsys Detect / Docker Inspector functionality avoids this potential for false positives. Isolating application components # If you are interested in components from the application layers of your image, but not interested in components from the underlying platform layers, you can exclude components from platform layers from the results. For example, if you build your application on ubuntu:latest (your Dockerfile starts with FROM ubuntu:latest), you can exclude components from the Ubuntu layer(s) so that the components generated by Synopsys Detect using Docker Inspector and the Black Duck Signature Scanner contain only components from your application layers. First, find the layer ID of the platform's top layer. To do this task: Run the docker inspect command on the base image; in our example this is ubuntu:latest. Find the last element in the RootFS.Layers array. This is the platform top layer ID. In the following example, this is sha256:b079b3fa8d1b4b30a71a6e81763ed3da1327abaf0680ed3ed9f00ad1d5de5e7c. Set the value of the Docker Inspector property docker.platform.top.layer.id to the platform top layer ID. For example: ./detect.sh ... --detect.docker.image={your application image} --detect.docker.platform.top.layer.id=sha256:b079b3fa8d1b4b30a71a6e81763ed3da1327abaf0680ed3ed9f00ad1d5de5e7c In this mode, there may be some loss in match accuracy from the Black Duck Signature Scanner because, in this scenario, the Black Duck Signature Scanner may be deprived of some contextual information, such as the operating system files that enable it to determine the Linux distribution, and that that may negatively affect its ability to accurately identify components. Inspecting Windows Docker images # Given a Windows Image, Docker Inspector, since it can only discover packages using a Linux package manager will not contribute any components to the BOM, but will return the container filesystem (in the form of a squashed image), which Synopsys Detect will scan using the Black Duck Signature Scanner.

Docker Inspector also supports more advanced deployment options that avoid this requirement by using image inspector services running elsewhere in the network; for more information, refer to the Docker Inspector documentation. Docker must be able to mount the shared directory as a volume # Docker Inspector uses Docker to mount a shared directory (a directory inside Synopsys Detect's output directory, which is controlled via property detect.output.path) so that it can be accessed (read from and written to) by the image inspector container.

The Pip detector attempts to run on your project if either a setup.py file is found, or a requirements.txt file is provided using the --detect.pip.requirements.path property. The Pip detector also requires Python and pip executables: Synopsys Detect looks for python (or python3 if the python3 property is set to true) on $PATH. You can override this by setting the python path property. Synopsys Detect looks for pip (or pip3 if the python3 property is set to true) on $PATH. The Pip detector runs the pip-inspector.py script , which uses Python/pip libraries to query the pip cache for the project, which may or may not be a virtual environment, for dependency information: pip-inspector.py queries for the project dependencies by project name which can be discovered using setup.py, or provided using the detect.pip.project.name property, using the pkg_resources library . If your project is installed into the pip cache, this discovers dependencies specified in setup.py. If a requirements.txt file is provided, pip-inspector.py uses the Python API called parse_requirements to query the requirements.txt file for possible additional dependencies, and uses the pkg_resources library to query for the details of each. The parse_requirements API is unstable, leading to the decision to deprecate this detector. Ramifications of this approach: Because pip-inspector.py uses the pkg_resources library to discover dependencies, only those packages which have been installed; using, for example, pip install , into the pip cache; in other words, appearing in the output of pip list , are included in the output. There must be a match between the package version on which your project depends and the package version installed in the pip cache. Additional details are available in the pkg_resources library documentation . If the packages are installed into a virtual environment for your project, you must run Synopsys Detect from within that virtual environment. Recommendations: Be sure that Synopsys Detect is finding the correct Python executable; this can be done by running the logging level at DEBUG and then reading the log. This is a particular concern if your system has multiple versions of Python installed; you must be sure Synopsys Detect is using the correct Python version. Create a setup.py file for your project. Install your project and dependencies into the pip cache: python setup.py install pip install -r requirements.txt The Pip detector derives your project name using your setup.py file if you have one. If you do not have a setup.py file, you must provide the correct project name using the propety --detect.pip.project.name. If there are any dependencies specified in requirements.txt that are not specified in setup.py, then provide the requirements.txt file using the Synopsys Detect property. If you are using a virtual environment, be sure to switch to that virtual environment when you run Synopsys Detect. This also applies when you are using a tool such as Poetry that sets up a Python virtual environment. Pipenv detector # The Pipenv detector discovers dependencies of Python projects. The Pipenv detector attempts to run on your project if either of the following is true: A Pipfile is found. A Pipfile.lock file is found. The Pipenv detector also requires Python and Pipenv executables: Synopsys Detect looks for python (or python3 if the python3 property is set to true) on $PATH. You can override this by setting the python path property. Synopsys Detect looks for pipenv on $PATH. The Pipenv detector runs pipenv run pip freeze and pipenv graph --bare --json-tree and derives dependency information from the output. The dependency hierarchy is derived from the output of pipenv graph --bare --json-tree . The output of pipenv run pip freeze is used to improve the accuracy of dependency versions. To troubleshoot of the Pipenv detector, start by running pipenv graph --bare --json-tree , and making sure that the output looks correct since this is the basis from which Synopsys Detect constructs the BDIO. If the output of pipenv graph --bare --json-tree does not look correct, make sure the packages (dependencies) are installed into the Pipenv virtual environment ( pipenv install ). Poetry detector # The Poetry detector discovers dependencies of Python projects. The Poetry detector attempts to run on your project if either of the following is true: A poetry.lock file is found. A pyproject.toml file is found. The Poetry detector parses poetry.lock for dependency information. If the detector discovers a pyproject.toml file but not a poetry.lock file, it will prompt the user to generate a poetry.lock by running poetry install and then run Detect again. If the Poetry detector extracts the project's name and version from the pyproject.toml file.

The Pip detector runs the pip-inspector.py script , which uses Python/pip libraries to query the pip cache for the project, which may or may not be a virtual environment, for dependency information: pip-inspector.py queries for the project dependencies by project name which can be discovered using setup.py, or provided using the detect.pip.project.name property, using the pkg_resources library . If your project is installed into the pip cache, this discovers dependencies specified in setup.py. If a requirements.txt file is provided, pip-inspector.py uses the Python API called parse_requirements to query the requirements.txt file for possible additional dependencies, and uses the pkg_resources library to query for the details of each. The parse_requirements API is unstable, leading to the decision to deprecate this detector. Ramifications of this approach: Because pip-inspector.py uses the pkg_resources library to discover dependencies, only those packages which have been installed; using, for example, pip install , into the pip cache; in other words, appearing in the output of pip list , are included in the output. There must be a match between the package version on which your project depends and the package version installed in the pip cache. Additional details are available in the pkg_resources library documentation . If the packages are installed into a virtual environment for your project, you must run Synopsys Detect from within that virtual environment. Recommendations: Be sure that Synopsys Detect is finding the correct Python executable; this can be done by running the logging level at DEBUG and then reading the log. This is a particular concern if your system has multiple versions of Python installed; you must be sure Synopsys Detect is using the correct Python version. Create a setup.py file for your project. Install your project and dependencies into the pip cache: python setup.py install pip install -r requirements.txt The Pip detector derives your project name using your setup.py file if you have one. If you do not have a setup.py file, you must provide the correct project name using the propety --detect.pip.project.name. If there are any dependencies specified in requirements.txt that are not specified in setup.py, then provide the requirements.txt file using the Synopsys Detect property. If you are using a virtual environment, be sure to switch to that virtual environment when you run Synopsys Detect. This also applies when you are using a tool such as Poetry that sets up a Python virtual environment.","title":"The Pip detector"},{"location":"advanced/package-managers/python/#pipenv-detector","text":"The Pipenv detector discovers dependencies of Python projects.

Synopsys Detect typically runs package manager commands or build tool commands similar to commands used in your build. When run by Synopsys Detect, those commands (as well as the environment in which they run) need to be consistent with your build, and it's important to verify that they are. For example, the Gradle detector defaults to running ./gradlew dependencies if it finds the file ./gradlew. If your build runs a different Gradle command or wrapper (say, /usr/local/bin/gradle), use property detect.gradle.path to tell Synopsys Detect to run the same Gradle command that your build runs. Check a DEBUG log for the package manager commands that Synopsys Detect is running, and compare them to the commands your build runs. For more troubleshooting information: Run Synopsys Detect with --detect.diagnostic=true . This will generate a diagnostic zip that contains many useful intermediate files and logs, including the generated BDIO (.jsonld) files and Black Duck Signature Scanner logs. For even more troubleshooting information: Run Synopsys Detect with --detect.diagnostic.extended=true . This will generate an extended diagnostic zip that will also include lock files and build artifacts when appropriate. See if you can reproduce the problem using the latest version of Synopsys Detect with the latest version of Black Duck. If not, the problem may be either fixed, or due to incompatible Synopsys Detect / Black Duck versions. Remember to consider the possibility that the Black Duck user lacks the necessary permissions (to create the project, update the BOM, receive notifications, etc.) in Black Duck. For more information, see Black Duck user role requirements . Remember to consider the possibility that the Black Duck server (registration key) may not have required capabilities enabled (binary upload, snippet scanning, etc.). For issues related to tools invoked by Synopsys Detect (Black Duck Signature Scanner, Docker Inspector, etc.), please check that tool's documentation. For issues related to incorrect components in the Black Duck BOM: Synopsys Detect has a great deal of control over matches produced by detectors (that are written to BDIO/.jsonld files), but no control over matches produced by the Black Duck Signature Scanner. When investigating an incorrect component in a Black Duck BOM, you need to determine whether the component was contributed by a detector, or by the Black Duck Signature Scanner: On the Black Duck Components tab for the project/version: Click on the \"N Matches\" link next to the component. The next screen lists the matches on the right side. Matches from the Black Duck Signature Scanner have a filename in the Name column. Matches from detectors have an external ID (such as \"org.hamcrest:hamcrest-core:1.3\") in the Name column. For issues related to components missing from or or incorrectly categorized in the Black Duck BOM: Synopsys Detect has a great deal of control over the production of .jsonld files (use --detect.diagnostic to save these), but no control over how they are converted into a BOM by Black Duck. A good first step is to determine whether the .jsonld files produced are correct. If they are incorrect, the problem is related to what Synopsys Detect is doing. If they are correct, but the BOM is incorrect, the problem is related to what Black Duck is doing. Similarly, Synopsys Detect is responsible for passing the correct arguments to the Black Duck Signature Scanner, but has little control over the results it produces. Synopsys Detect is a Spring Boot application, and leverages Spring Boot to provide various mechanism to configure it through property settings: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html. This flexibility comes with a risk: it's possible for Synopsys Detect to be influenced by files (application.properties, application.xml) that may exist in the directory from which Synopsys Detect is run that are intended for some other application. This can produce some strange results. If properties have unexpected values (see the Synopsys Detect log), this is a possibility worth considering. The best solution may be simply to run Synopsys Detect from a different (ideally empty) directory (use the --detect.source.path argument). Similarly, Synopsys Detect can be influenced by environment variables via the same Spring Boot mechanism, so it's worth checking the environment for variables that correspond to Synopsys Detect property names. Diagnostic mode # Synopsys Detect's diagnostic mode automatically enabled debug logging (where possible), saves all output (logs and inspector files) to a zip file, and notifies you of the location of the zip. Diagnostic mode properties are: --detect.diagnostic : When enabled, diagnostic mode collects all files generated by Synopsys Detect and zips the files using a unique run ID. It includes logs, BDIO files, extraction files, and reports. --detect.diagnostic.extended : When enabled, Synopsys Detect collects relevant files such as lock files and build artifacts. The zip file is created inside the Synopsys Detect output directory, and must be provided when support issues are opened. Synopsys does not recommend keeping this option on, as it does not clean up the zip file(s); regardless of the Synopsys Detect cleanup flag. Diagnostic mode: Sets the output log level to DEBUG. Zips the entire run directory of Synopsys Detect which includes: All BDIO files created by Synopsys Detect. Any intermediary files generated by Synopsys Detect, such as Gradle inspector output files. Includes any additional reports Synopsys Detect might make such as dependency counts. Additionally --detect.diagnostic or --detect.diagnostic.extended includes additional relevant files such as: Npm package locks. vendor.config. C/C++ compilation database. The property --detect.diagnostic.extended, when set to true, enables the collection of relevant files that are not generated by Synopsys Detect; for example, lock files. By default, diagnostic mode only includes files generated by Synopsys Detect where --detect.diagnostic.extended might include files it finds.
