# Status File

[solution_name] creates an output status file in the run folder with the name "status.json" which contains a summary of the [solution_name] run in a machine readable format.

The file includes status codes, issues encountered and results produced. As additional processes consume this file, additional information will be added. The format is intended to evolve over time.

* As [solution_name] shuts down, by default, it performs cleanup operations which include deleting the status file.  You can disable clean up by setting ```--detect.cleanup=false```.

## Body

## #Detector Status Codes
| Status Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
<#list statusCodes as statusCode>
    | ${statusCode.statusCode} | ${statusCode.statusCodeDescription} |
</#list>

## Status
```
{
"key": The normalized key this status element describes such as "GIT".
"status": "SUCCESS" or "FAILURE"
}
```

## Issues
```
{
"type": A key describing the type of issue, currently "EXCEPTION", "DEPRECATION" or "DETECTOR".
"title": A string describing the issue.
"messages": A list of a strings describing the details of the issue.
}
```

## Results

A result is a URL, file path to output, or messages produced by the [solution_name] run: a [blackduck_product_name] Bill Of Materials, Risk Report, Notices Report, Air Gap zip, or Rapid Scan results.
```
{
"location": The path to the result.
"message": A string describing the result.
"sub_messages": A list of strings providing more detail about the result.
}
```

## Unrecognized Paths

For those detectors that support it (currently, only CLANG), a list of file paths to dependencies that
(a) were not recognized by the package manager, and (b) reside outside the source directory.
````
{
"<Detector type>": [ A list of file paths to unrecognized dependencies ]
}
````

## Code Locations
````
{
"codeLocationName": The name of a code location produced by this run of Synopsys Detect.
"scanType": The type of scan that was performed, DETECTOR, BINARY_SCAN, SIGNATURE_SCAN, or CONTAINER_SCAN.
"scanId": The UUID for the scan.
}
````
## Property Values

A map of every property key to it's string value that [solution_name] found. These are only properties to which [solution_name] has a known key,
so pass-through properties like Docker and dynamic properties like custom fields are not included. Passwords and other sensitive fields are masked.

````
  "propertyValues": {
    "key": "value",
    "boolean-key": "true"
  }
````

## Operations
A list of information regarding internal execution of [solution_name] to describe when portions of [solution_name] run and what their status is.
This information is intended to be used when [solution_name] fails and the reason(s) for a [solution_name] failure.
````
  "operations": {
    "startTimestamp": A formatted UTC timestamp when the execution started.
    "endTimestamp": A formatted UTC timestamp when the execution ended.
    "descriptionKey": A string that describes what is being executed.
    "status": "SUCCESS" or "FAILURE"
  }
