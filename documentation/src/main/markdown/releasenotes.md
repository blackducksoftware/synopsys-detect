# Release notes

## Version 8.3.0

### New features

* Added support for Reduced Persistence Signature Scanning. This feature allows users to specify if unmatched files should be persisted or discarded. Not storing data for unmatched files decreases scan time and database size. Note: this feature requires Black Duck 2022.10.0 or later.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-3285) go.mod file "// indirects" matching as Direct Dependencies.  Additional information for the go project is obtained in order to definitively establish direct module dependencies and then establish which module dependencies are transitive.

* (IDETECT-3228) Resolved an issue that caused certain Maven dependency tree formats to not be parsed.

## Version 8.2.0

### New features

* Ephemeral Scan, or Ephemeral Scan Mode, is a new way of running [solution_name] with [blackduck_product_name]. This mode is designed to be as fast as possible and does not persist any data on [blackduck_product_name]. See the [Ephemeral Scans page](downloadingandrunning/ephemeralscan.md) for further details.
* The output for Rapid and the new Ephemeral Scan Modes will now include upgrade guidance for security errors and warnings.

## Version 8.1.1

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-3509) Corrected the version of the NuGet Inspector built into the air gap zip files (from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2).

## Version 8.1.0

### New features

* Added support for Bazel project dependencies specified via a github released artifact location (URL) in an *http_archive* workspace rule.
* Added property detect.project.inspector.path to enable pointing [solution_name] to a local Project Inspector zip file.
* Added property detect.status.json.output.path to place a copy of the status.json file in a specified directory.

### Changed features

* Enhancements to error reporting to ensure that any exception will have the root cause reported in the error message for certain exception types.
* Overall Detect exit status is now being reported along with individual detector status/issues in the Status.json file.
* The __MACOSX directory will now be ignored by default when determining which detectors are applicable to a project.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-3419) Resolved an issue where the NuGet inspector cannot be found when a solution file cannot be found but multiple C# projects are found by Detect.
* (IDETECT-3306) Resolved an issue where a NullPointerException would occur when project inspector discovered no modules for a project.
* (IDETECT-3307) Warn when project inspector cannot be downloaded, installed, or found.
* (IDETECT-3187) Report Black Duck provided error message (from response body) whenever a Black Duck api call returns an error code
* (IDETECT-3311) Include Detect's "Overall Status" in the status.json / diagnostic zip
* (IDETECT-3449) Resolved an issue that caused overridden violations to be reported as active violations when the BOM contained additional active violations.
* (IDETECT-3476) Resolved an issue that caused an "Input request parsing error" on IaC scans on certain projects when running on Windows.

## Version 8.0.0

### New features

* [solution_name] will now retry (until timeout; see property `detect.timeout`) BDIO2 uploads that fail with a non-fatal exit code.
* Added Detector cascade. Refer to [Detector search and accuracy](downloadingandrunning/detectorcascade.md) for more information.

### Changed features

* The default value of `detect.project.clone.categories` now includes DEEP_LICENSE (added to Black Duck in 2022.2.0), raising the minimum version of Black Duck for [solution_name] 8.0.0 to 2022.2.0.
* The [codelocation naming scheme](naming/projectversionscannaming.md#code-location-scan-naming) has changed. To prevent old codelocations from contributing stale results to re-scanned projects, set property `detect.project.codelocation.unmap` to true for the first run of [solution_name] 8. This will unmap the old codelocations.
* The default value of `detect.force.success.on.skip` has changed to false, so by default [solution_name] will exit with return code FAILURE_MINIMUM_INTERVAL_NOT_MET (13) when a scan is skipped because the Black Duck minimum scan interval has not been met.
* By default, all detectors now include in their dependency graph all discovered
dependencies, packages, and configurations, because the default for
properties `detect.*.[dependency|package|configuration].types.excluded` is NONE. 
This is a change in the default behavior for the following detector types: 
GO_MOD, GRADLE, LERNA, RUBYGEMS.
* Dropped NONE as a supported value for the following properties: `detect.included.detector.types`, `detect.tools`.
* Dropped ALL as a supported value for the following properties: `detect.excluded.detector.types`, `detect.tools.excluded`.
* Removed support for parsing SBT report files.
* Cargo project dependency graphs are no longer post-processed to reduce direct dependencies in the BOM.
* Removed the ability to upload BDIO2 documents to legacy endpoints via the `blackduck.legacy.upload.enabled` property.
* Removed the ability to choose the type of BDIO aggregation strategy via the now removed `detect.bom.aggregate.remediation.mode` property.  All BDIO will be aggregated in a manner similar to [solution_name] 7's SUBPROJECT remediation mode.
* [solution_name] now only produces a single Scan in Black Duck for Detectors, named (by default) "\<projectName\>/\<projectVersion\> Black Duck I/O Export". 
* detect8.sh has improvements (relative to detect7.sh and detect.sh) related to argument handling that simplify its argument quoting/escaping requirements.
* [solution_name] requires and runs [docker_inspector_name] version 10.
* Incorporated [docker_inspector_name] documentation into [solution_name] documentation.
* The search for files for binary scanning (when property `detect.binary.scan.file.name.patterns` is set) now excludes directories specified by property `detect.excluded.directories`.
* The status.json field `detectors[n].descriptiveName` (which was simply a hyphen-separated concatenation of the `detectorType` and `detectorName` fields) has been removed.
* There is no longer a distinction between extended and non-extended diagnostic zip files. All diagnostic zip files now include all relevant files.
* The following properties (that were deprecated in [solution_name] 7.x) have been removed: `blackduck.legacy.upload.enabled`, `detect.bazel.dependency.type`,
`detect.bdio2.enabled`, `detect.bom.aggregate.name`, `detect.bom.aggregate.remediation.mode`, `detect.conan.include.build.dependencies`, `detect.detector.buildless`,
`detect.docker.path.required`, `detect.dotnet.path`, `detect.go.mod.enable.verification`, `detect.gradle.include.unresolved.configurations`, `detect.gradle.inspector.version`,
`detect.lerna.include.private`, `detect.maven.buildless.legacy.mode`, `detect.maven.include.plugins`, `detect.npm.include.dev.dependencies`, `detect.npm.include.peer.dependencies`,
`detect.nuget.inspector.version`, `detect.packagist.include.dev.dependencies`, `detect.pear.only.required.deps`, `detect.pnpm.dependency.types`,
`detect.pub.deps.exclude.dev`, `detect.ruby.include.dev.dependencies`, `detect.ruby.include.runtime.dependencies`, `detect.sbt.excluded.configurations`,
`detect.sbt.included.configurations`, `detect.sbt.report.search.depth`, `detect.yarn.prod.only`.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-3375) Resolved an issue where [solution_name] would unnecessarily upload empty BDIO entry file when initiating an IaC scan.
* (IDETECT-3224) Resolved an issue where Cargo projects with Cyclical dependencies could cause a failure of [solution_name].
* (IDETECT-3246) Resolved an issue where [solution_name] would fail when scanning flutter projects after a new version of flutter was released.
* (IDETECT-3275) Resolved an issue that caused impact analysis to fail with an "Unsupported class file major version" error when an analyzed .class file contained invalid version bytes (byte 7 and 8).
* (IDETECT-3180) Resolved an issue that caused the Binary Search tool to throw an exception when the patterns provided via property detect.binary.scan.file.name.patterns matched one or more directories.
* (IDETECT-3352) Resolved an issue that caused the Gradle Project Inspector detector to fail when the value of detect.output.path was a relative path.
* (IDETECT-3371) Resolved an issue that could cause some transitive dependencies to be omitted from aggregated BDIO in cases where the transitive dependencies provided by the package manager for a component differed across subprojects.

## Version 7.14.0

### New features
* Added support for Swift projects built with Swift 5.6 or later.

* Added support for running IaC scans via [solution_name]. See [IaC Scan](downloadingandrunning/iacscan.md) for more details. Note: IaC capabilities require Black Duck 2022.7.0 or later.

## Version 7.13.2

* (IDETECT-3291) Resolved an issue where the NuGet Inspector would only be found for the first applicable detector.
* (IDETECT-3289) Resolved an issue where the NuGet Inspector could not handle Implicit Dependencies in a Package Reference. 

## Version 7.13.1

* (IDETECT-3286) Resolved an issue that caused the 7.13.0 .jar to be unsigned. The 7.13.1 .jar is signed.

## Version 7.13.0

### New features
* Added support for a buildless Pipenv detector that parses the Pipfile.lock file (see the [python support page](packagemgrs/python.md) for more details).
* [solution_name] now includes pass-through properties when logging configuration at the beginning of a run.
* Added support for Xcode Workspaces (see the [swift support page](packagemgrs/swift.md) for more details).

### Changed features
* Nuget Inspector is now shipped as a self-contained executable and has no runtime requirements. 
* Deprecated property detect.detector.buildless, to be replaced with detect.accuracy.required. See [property description](properties/configuration/detector.md#detector-accuracy-requirements-advanced) for more details.

### Resolved issues
* (IDETECT-3136) Resolved an issue where NPM's `package-lock.json` was prioritized over `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.
* (IDETECT-3184) Resolved an issue that prevented matches for Bazel maven_install components with complex (>3 parts) maven_coordinates values.
* (IDETECT-3207) Resolved an issue that prevented Bazel and Docker Tool issues from being reported in the issues section of the [solution_name] log and status file.

### Dependency update

* Upgraded to Spring Boot version 2.6.6 / Spring version 5.3.18.

## Version 7.12.1

### Changed Features

* When signature scanning is skipped due to the minimum scan interval on Black Duck not being met, [solution_name] by default will treat the run as a success and will not wait for the skipped scan(s). If the property detect.force.success.on.skip is set to false, [solution_name] will instead return exit code 13 when one or more signature scans were skipped.

## Version 7.12.0

### New features

* Verified support for Java 16 and 17.
* Added new properties detect.gradle.excluded.project.paths and detect.gradle.included.project.paths to allow filtering on paths which gradle guarantees to be unique.
* Added support for vendoring Go Mod dependencies using [detect.go.mod.dependency.types.excluded=VENDORED](properties/detectors/go.md#go-mod-dependency-types-excluded) to exclude *test* and *build system* dependencies from Go modules declaring a version prior to `Go 1.16`.
* Added a feature that allows users to configure [solution_name] to fail when policies of a certain name are violated.
  See [detect.policy.check.fail.on.names](properties/configuration/project.md#fail-on-policy-names-with-violations) for details. Note: this feature requires Black Duck 2022.2.0 or later.
* Added Rapid Compare Mode which enables returning only the differences in policy violations compared to a previous scan.

### Changed features

* Changed default value of detect.project.clone.categories from ALL to COMPONENT_DATA, CUSTOM_FIELD_DATA, LICENSE_TERM_FULFILLMENT, VERSION_SETTINGS, VULN_DATA.  This avoids the automatic setting of the clone category DEEP_LICENSE introduced in Black Duck 2022.2.0. Users of [solution_name] 7.12.0 that wish to pass DEEP_LICENSE or ALL as a value to detect.project.clone.categories must be using Black Duck 2022.2.0 or later.
* Added new property detect.bazel.workspace.rules to replace the now deprecated detect.bazel.dependency.type property.
* For Go Mod projects, successfully executing `go version` is now required. Unsuccessful attempts now result in a run failure.
* The property *detect.go.mod.dependency.types.excluded* now only accepts a single value rather than a list of values.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-3016) Resolved an issue where proxies may block HEAD requests made by [solution_name] when attempting to download the Signature Scanner from Black Duck. Because the
  criteria that [solution_name] uses to download the Black Duck Signature Scanner is new, the next run will re-download the Signature Scanner.
* (IDETECT-3165) Resolved an issue that could cause the Bitbake detector to fail with error `Graph Node recipe ... does not correspond to any known layer`.

## Version 7.11.1

### Changed features

* Updated [solution_name] to package Air Gap with the latest Nuget Inspectors: IntegrationNugetInspector:3.1.1, BlackduckNugetInspector:1.1.1, NugetDotnet3Inspector:1.1.1,
  NugetDotnet5Inspector:1.1.1.

## Version 7.11.0

### New features

* Added a feature that allows users to set a license for a project version using the
  property [detect.project.version.license](properties/configuration/project.md#project-version-license).
* Added support for identifying dependency relationships between Linux package manager components in images.

### Changed features

* The Go Mod Cli Detector no longer uses the "-u" flag when running **go list -m all**. This results in significantly faster scan times against Go Mod projects.
* Deprecated the `detect.pnpm.dependency.types` property in favor of `detect.pnpm.dependency.types.excluded` for property consistency.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-2925) Resolved an issue that could cause the Bitbake detector to incorrectly identify the layer of a dependency recipe.
* (IDETECT-3080) Fixed an issue where [solution_name] would not include multiple versions of the same package in Cargo projects.
* (IDETECT-3012) Resolved an issue that caused [solution_name] to incorrectly use BLACKDUCK_USERNAME and BLACKDUCK_PASSWORD.

## Version 7.10.0

### New features

* Added support for the Apache Ivy package manager.
* Build dependencies can now be excluded from BitBake results.

### Changed features

* [solution_name] now classifies empty code location warning messages as the DEBUG logging level instead of the previous classification as the WARN logging level.
* BitBake detector: Added support for BitBake 1.52 (Yocto 3.4).
* BitBake detector: Added support for BitBake projects with build directories that reside outside the project directory.
* Deprecated many properties relating to filtering dependency types from the BOM. These property replacements will reduce the number of properties, apply consistency to detector
  properties, add filtering abilities, and overall simplify Detect configuration.
    * Deprecated the following properties:
        * detect.conan.include.build.dependencies
        * detect.pub.deps.exclude.dev
        * detect.go.mod.enable.verification
        * detect.gradle.include.unresolved.configurations

        * detect.pear.only.required.deps
        * detect.ruby.include.runtime.dependencies
        * detect.ruby.include.dev.dependencies
        * detect.yarn.prod.only
    * Added the following replacement properties:
        * detect.conan.dependency.types.excluded
        * detect.pub.dependency.types.excluded
        * detect.go.mod.dependency.types.excluded
        * detect.gradle.configuration.types.excluded

* (IDETECT-2859) Resolved an issue where [solution_name] was using an outdated cookie spec when making a request, resulting in a warning message.

## Version 7.6.0

### New features

* Added the property [detect.follow.symbolic.links](properties/configuration/general.md#follow-symbolic-links) which can be used to enable [solution_name] to follow symbolic links
  when searching directories for detectors, when creating exclusions for signature scan, and when creating binary scan targets.
* Added support for Open Container Initiative (OCI) images provided to [solution_name] using the *detect.docker.tar* property.
* Added the property [detect.gradle.include.unresolved.configurations](properties/detectors/gradle.md#gradle-include-unresolved-configurations-advanced) for toggling the inclusion
  of [unresolved Gradle configurations](https://docs.gradle.org/7.2/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html#sec:resolvable-consumable-configs).
* Added Project Inspector support for MAVEN and GRADLE when resolving buildless dependencies.
* Added support for NUGET buildless using the Project Inspector.

### Changed features

* The detect.project.clone.categories property now supports ALL and NONE as options.
* The the default value for property detect.project.clone.categories has changed to ALL.
* Deprecated detect.bom.aggregate.name, detect.bom.aggregate.remediation.mode, and blackduck.legacy.upload.enabled. In version 8, [solution_name] will only operate in SUBPROJECT
  aggregation mode to report the dependency graph with greater accuracy.
* Maven defaults to the legacy buildless parser, Project Inspector must be enabled with detect.maven.buildless.legacy.mode. In version 8, it will default to Project Inspector.
* Deprecated detect.maven.include.plugins as Project Inspector does not support plugins. In version 8, we will only support the Project Inspector Maven implementation which will
  have its own configuration mechanism.
* The Air Gap Zip generation options no longer support individual package managers. Instead, either a FULL air gap can be created, or a NO_DOCKER air gap can be created. This is to
  help support project inspector which spans multiple package managers.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-2834) Resolved an issue where GoMod components missing a version were not being properly filtered causing a NullPointerException.
* (IDETECT-2829) Resolved an issue that caused [solution_name] to use the wrong scan cli when in offline mode and ignore a specified local scan cli.
* (IDETECT-2820) Resolved an issue where pypi components in conda projects were not being matched.

### New features

* Added support for the Dart package manager.

### Changed features

* The following directories are no longer excluded from Signature Scan by default: bin, build, out, packages, target. .synopsys directories are now excluded from both Detector
  search and Signature Scan.
* The Docker Inspector can now be included (using the detect.tools property) when using
  the [rapid scan mode](properties/configuration/blackduck-server.md#detect-scan-mode-advanced).
* Instead of "lite" Docker images that automatically disable all detectors, [solution_name] now supports "buildless" Docker images that automatically disable detectors that depend
  on the presence of build tools but leave buildless detectors enabled.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-2830) Resolved an issue that caused the Gradle detector to fail when run in air gap mode.
* (IDETECT-2816) Resolved an issue that caused a "Duplicate key" error when running binary scan on multiple files with the same name.

### New features

* Added support for the Carthage package manager.

### Changed features

* The Poetry detector is no longer categorized as a PIP detector and is now categorized under detector type POETRY.
* Simplified the property deprecation lifecycle to the following: Use of deprecated properties will result in logged warnings until the next major version release, at which time
  those properties will be removed from Detect (and ignored if used). Properties that were deprecated in Detect 6.x have been removed in this release. Properties deprecated in
  Detect 7.x will be removed in Detect 8.0.0.

  characters.
* (IDETECT-2672) Resolved an issue that could cause the Black Duck access token to appear in the log.
* (IDETECT-2739) Resolved an issue that caused the default to be used when the provided Risk Report path did not exist.

## Version 7.1.0

### New features

* Added ability to specify custom fonts to be used during risk report generation. See [here](results/reports.md#risk-report-generation) for more details.
* There now exist Docker images that can be used to run [solution_name] from within a container.
  See [Running Synopsys Detect from within a Docker container](downloadingandrunning/runincontainer.md#running-synopsys-detect-from-within-a-docker-container) for more details.

  system.

## Version 7.0.0

### New features

* Added scripts detect7.sh and detect7.ps1 for invoking [solution_name] 7.x.x. detect.sh and detect.ps1 will (by default) continue to invoke the latest [solution_name] 6 version.
* Added support for Yarn workspaces.
* Added support for the dependency graph SBT plugin. Resolution cache generation is no longer a requirement of the SBT detector.
* Added the properties [detect.excluded.directories](properties/configuration/paths.md#detect-excluded-directories-advanced),
  [detect.excluded.directories.defaults.disabled](properties/configuration/paths.md#detect-excluded-directories-defaults-disabled-advanced),
  and [detect.excluded.directories.search.depth](properties/configuration/signature-scanner.md#detect-excluded-directories-search-depth) to handle exclusions for detector search
  and signature scanning.
* Added ability to specify excluded directory paths
  using [glob patterns](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String)).
* Added properties [detect.lerna.excluded.packages](properties/detectors/lerna.md#lerna-packages-excluded-advanced)
  and [detect.lerna.included.packages](properties/detectors/lerna.md#lerna-packages-included-advanced) to exclude and include specific Lerna packages.
* Added critical security risks to the Black Duck Risk Report pdf.
* Added detect.target.type to enhance the docker user experience. When set to IMAGE, some tools are automatically disabled and detect optimizes for an image-based scan.
* Added binary scanning of the container filesystem to the default Docker image scanning workflow. If you are scanning Docker images and your Black Duck server does not have the
  binary scanning feature enabled; use --detect.tools.exluded=BINARY_SCAN to disable the binary scan step.

### Changed features

* The following directories will be excluded from signature scan by default, in addition to node_modules: bin, build, .git, .gradle, out, packages, target. Use
  [detect.excluded.directories.defaults](properties/configuration/paths.md#detect-excluded-directories-defaults-disabled-advanced) to disable these defaults.
* Detect no longer supports the exclusion of individual files during detector search, only directories.
* Gradle detector no longer uses the gradle inspector. Only the init script is required.
* The default BDIO format for communicating dependency graphs to Black Duck has been changed from BDIO1 to BDIO2.
* Risk report generation will download fonts from Artifactory or use the font files in the fonts directory in the air gap zip of detect.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-2462) Resolved an issue where projects were being inaccurately diagnosed as Poetry projects due to the presence of a pyproject.toml file.
* (IDETECT-2527) Resolved an issue in the Go Mod detector to extract and process data even if 'go mod why' command fails to run.
* (IDETECT-2434) Resolved an issue in the CLANG detector on Ubuntu and Debian systems that caused it to omit a package when that package had been installed on the system from
  multiple architectures.
* (IDETECT-2362) The CLANG detector now uses the KB preferred alias namespace feature for improved match accuracy.
* (IDETECT-2413) Resolved an issue to upgrade internal dependencies to support JDK 15.
* (IDETECT-2409) Resolved an issue to allow Gradle detector to support Gradle 6.8.
* (IDETECT-2099) Improved error reporting for exceptions that occur during a Detect run. For each exception, a Detect "issue" is written to the log and to the status.json file.
* (IDETECT-2516) Improved error reporting for the case where environment variable BDS_JAVA_HOME is set incorrectly.

## Version 6.9.1

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-2555) Resolved an issue that could cause Detect, when run against Black Duck 2020.10.0, to fail with a message like: "Cannot cast... to...
  VersionBomCodeLocationBomComputedNotificationUserView".

## Version 6.9.0

### New features

  CVE-2019-12402)

## Version 6.0.0

### New features

* Added the property detect.binary.scan.file.name.patterns.
* Added the property detect.detector.search.exclusion.files which accepts a comma-separated list of file names to exclude from the Detector search.
* Custom arguments for the source command can now be supplied to Detect through the property detect.bitbake.source.arguments which accepts a comma-separated list of arguments. (
    1614)
* Added support for the Swift package manager.
* Added support for GoGradle.
* Added support for Go Modules.
* The property detect.pip.requirements.path is now a comma-separated list of paths to requirements.txt files. This enables you to specify multiple requirements files. Each
  requirements file displays as a new code location in Black Duck.
* Detect now logs username, roles, and groups for the current user.
* Detect now includes the project name/version in every code location name.
* Detect now takes in a go path but does not take in go.dep.path; nor does Detect trigger on *.go.

  detect.blackduck.signature.scanner.parallel.processors and detect.hub.signature.scanner.parallel.processors.
* Added the property detect.maven.included.scopes. This is a comma-separated list of Maven scopes. Output is limited to dependencies within these scopes, and is overridden by
  exclude.
* Added the property detect.maven.excluded.scopes. This is a comma-separated list of Maven scopes. Output is limited to dependencies outside these scopes, and is overridden by
  include.
* Bazel detector: added support for dependencies specified using the maven_install workspace rule. The detect.bazel.advanced.rules.path property is removed.
* When using Detect for static analysis, you can pass the build command to let the Polaris CLI know how to analyze a given project.

### Changed features

* Architecture is no longer included in BitBake dependencies discovered by Detect. The property detect.bitbake.reference.impl is no longer used and is deprecated.
* The BitBake detector no longer uses the property detect.bitbake.reference.impl because architecture is no longer required to match with artifacts in the KnowledgeBase. The
  Bitbake detector now attempts to determine the layer in which a component originated instead of the architecture.
* Improved the Detect on-screen logging to be more concise.
* The PiP inspector is no longer deprecated and is currently supported.
* When creating an air gap zip of Detect using the switch -z or --zip, the created zip file is now published to your output directory.
* Scripts no longer fail if the Artifactory server is unavailable.
* Enhanced placement and formatting of deprecation logs.
* Added support for Java version 11.
* The following properties are removed in Detect version 6.0.0:
* detect.go.dep.path
* detect.npm.node.path
* detect.perl.path
* detect.go.run.dep.init
* detect.maven.scope
* detect.bazel.advanced.rules.path

### Resolved issues

* Resolved an issue wherein the Windows Java path construction did not account for direction of the slash. The shell script now uses the correct slash direction, based on the
  operating system on which Detect is running.
* Resolved an issue wherein Detect was not finding the file recipe-depends.dot written to the current directory. Detect now looks in the source directory to a depth of 1 if it
  cannot find the expected files in the expected location.
* Resolved an issue wherein Detect was failing if it could not resolve placeholders.
* Resolved an issue wherein Detect was not handling SSH URLs, which caused Detect to fail in extracting project information from the Git executable. GitCliDetectable now properly
  handles SSH URLs.
* Resolved an issue wherein the Detect JAR was downloading for each scan when the script could not communicate with Artifactory. Now, if the script cannot communicate with
  Artifactory, and there is an existing downloaded Detect, then the previously downloaded version of Detect runs. However, if you provided a DETECT_LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION and
  Detect cannot communicate with Artifactory, Detect will not run.
* Resolved an issue wherein Detect was not properly parsing GIT URLs such as git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git.

## Version 5.6.2

### Resolved issues

* Synopsys Detect version 5.6.2 is a rebuild of version 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 to address an issue with the binary repository to which it was published.

## Version 5.6.0

### New features

* You can now set custom fields on created Black Duck projects.
* Detect can now generate its own air gap zip.
* Detectors now nest by default.
* Added support for Gradle Kotlin.
* Added support for wildcard (*) in the Detect flag blackduck.proxy.ignored.hosts.
* Added support for --detect.project.tags.
* Added the properties --detect.parent.project.name and --detect.parent.project.version.name.
* Added the property --detect.clone.project.version.latest=true which takes precedence over the exact version name.
* Added support for Yocto 2.0.0.
* Added support to parse components from the &lt;plugins&gt; block in pom.xml. This only works when detect.detector.buildless=true.
* Added capability to represent '' and "" as a null value in Detect multiselect custom fields.

### Changed features

* You can now specify the search depth for buildless mode.
* Updated the help menu and provided more detailed help options.
* Diagnostics now includes signature scanner log files.
* Re-enabled empty aggregate file generation.
* Polaris no longer runs the -w switch enabled by default. To retrieve the issue/policy count, you can use the -w switch.
* Match accuracy for Docker images is improved by running the signature scanner on a squashed version of the Docker image instead of the container file system. This results in a
  different name for the code location because the name of the file being scanned is different. For existing projects, the old code location named by default as &lt;repo&gt;_
  &lt;tag&gt;_containerfilesystem.tar.gz/&lt;repo&gt;/&lt;tag&gt; scan must be removed to ensure it does not contribute stale data to the BOM. Due to the new method of scanning,
  the code location name has changed. You must remove the old code location in favor of the new code location.

### Resolved issues

* Resolved an issue that could cause code location names to contain relative file paths when the value of detect.source.path uses symbolic links to specify the source directory.
* Resolved an issue that caused detect.sh to fail when Java is not on the system path, and the JAVA_HOME path contains a space.
* Resolved an issue wherein the signature scanner may not have been reporting failures correctly.
* Resolved an issue wherein Detect was not locating the file recipe-depends.dot when it was written to the current directory. Detect now searches for the recipe-depends.dot file to
  a depth of 1 when extracting on a BitBake project.
* Detect no longer fails if the Git executable is not found.
* Resolved an issue wherein Detect may fail when the directory pointed to by --detect.notices.report.path does not exist.

## Version 5.5.1

### Resolved issues

* Resolved an issue wherein the Pipenv detector was omitting project dependencies.

## Version 5.5.0

### New features

* Added support for snippet modes.
* The property detect.wait.for.results has been added to wait for Black Duck. The default value is false. If this property is set to true, Detect won't complete until the normal
  timeout is reached or the underlying systems with which Detect is communicating are once again idle and ready to receive more data. The timeout value is controlled by
  blackduck.timeout.
* The shell script and PowerShell script now accept DETECT_JAVA_PATH and DETECT_JAVA_HOME as environment variables for pointing to your Java installation.
* Added a new property --detect.detector.search.exclusion.paths. A comma-separated list of directory paths to exclude from a detector search. For example, foo/bar/biz only excludes
  the biz directory if the parent directory structure is
  'foo/bar/'.
* Detect now uses Git information to determine the default project and version names.
* There is a new Detect property for overriding the Git executable: detect.git.path.

### Resolved issues

* Resolved an issue that caused the risk report to be generated with invalid links to Black Duck components.
* Resolved an issue that caused a null pointer exception error when a golang's Gopkg.lock file contained zero projects.
* Resolved an issue wherein the Clang detector could omit the epoch from the version string in RPM packages.
* Resolved an issue wherein with two users running Detect on a single system may result in a Permission denied error.
* Resolved an issue wherein the property -detect.policy.check.fail.on.severities may not be waiting for the snippet scans to complete.
* Resolved an issue wherein the property --detect.blackduck.signature.scanner.exclusion.name.patterns may not be following the paths.
* Resolved an issue wherein Detect may fail when the directory specified by --detect.risk.report.pdf.path did not exist. Detect now attempts to create the directory structure to
  the specified path. A warning is logged if Detect fails to create the directory.
* Resolved an issue wherein properties that had a primary group and additional property group may have been excluded from the group search.
* Resolved an issue wherein the deprecation warning displayed when the deprecated property was provided by the user.
* Resolved an issue with aggregate BOM filename generation that could cause the message Unable to relativize path, full source path will be used to display in the log.
* Resolved an issue that could cause components to be omitted from the BOM for Conda projects.
* Resolved an issue that could cause errors during parsing of Maven projects with long subproject names.

### Changed features

* The default value for the property detect.docker.path.required is now false.
* The ALL logging level is replaced with the TRACE logging level.
* The results URL for the Black Duck project BOM is now moved to the Detect Results panel.
* Renamed Detect Results to Detect Status.
* Previously, a temp file remained which could contain plain text user name or password information. This temp file is now removed.
* Bazel is added as an acceptable value to the detect.tools properties.
* Detect now uses the current version of Docker Inspector. This means that no matter what version of Docker Inspector is currently released, Detect now uses that version.

## Version 5.4.0

### New features

* Added buildless mode.
* Added a new property for BitBake to remove Yocto reference implementation characters.
* Added a new property for adding group names to projects.

* Resolved an issue that could cause a counter (an integer intended to ensure uniqueness), to be unnecessarily appended to a code location name.
* Resolved an issue that may have caused the package manager name to be excluded from the code location name when a code location name was provided.
* Resolved an issue that could cause Detect to continue after a Polaris connection failure.
* Resolved an issue wherein the Detect scan results may incorrectly show development dependencies.
* Resolved an issue that could cause reports to fail due to timeout intermittently.
* Resolved an issue that could cause the value of --polaris.access.token to be logged to the console when detect.sh is invoked.
* Resolved an issue wherein Detect was cleaning up the contents but not the directory of the run.

### Changed features

* For getting all logs, the ALL logging level is now TRACE.
* Improved the error message logged when the property detect.binary.scan.file.path, which must point to a readable file, points to something other than a readable file, such as a
  directory.
* Changed the environment variable used to tell the Detect scripts where to download the Detect jar. The previous value DETECT_JAR_PATH is now changed to DETECT_JAR_DOWNLOAD_DIR.
* Improved the parsing of packrat.lock files to better represent the relationships between dependencies in the graph.
* The version of Detect is no longer part of the code location name.

## Version 5.3.3

* Resolved an issue wherein reports for projects containing risks may be generated with a status of zero risks shown.

## Version 5.3.2

* Synopsys Detect version 5.3.2 is a minor maintenance release.

## Version 5.3.1

### New features

* Added new property detect.ignore.connection.failures which enables Synopsys Detect to continue even if it fails to talk to Black Duck.

### Resolved issues

* Resolved an issue wherein build scan failures may occur in TFS with the error `[COPY Operation] noSuchPath in source, path provided: //license/ownership`.
* Resolved an issue wherein if the property detect.clone.project.version.name is set to a non-existent project version, the log messages are now improved to make it easier to
