# Common problems

- See if you can reproduce the problem using the latest version of [solution_name] with the latest version of [blackduck_product_name]. If not, the problem may be either fixed, or due to incompatible [solution_name] / [blackduck_product_name] versions.
- Remember to consider the possibility that the [blackduck_product_name] user lacks the necessary permissions (to create the project, update the BOM, receive notifications, etc.) in [blackduck_product_name]. For more information, see [Black Duck user role requirements](../gettingstarted/usersandroles.md).
- Remember to consider the possibility that the [blackduck_product_name] server (registration key) may not have required capabilities enabled (binary upload, snippet scanning, etc.).

## Incorrect or missing components

- For issues related to tools invoked by [solution_name] ([blackduck_signature_scanner_name], Docker Inspector, etc.), please check that tool's documentation.
- For issues related to incorrect components in the [blackduck_product_name] BOM: [solution_name] has a great deal of control over matches produced by detectors (that are written to BDIO files), but no control over matches produced by the [blackduck_signature_scanner_name] / [blackduck_product_name]. When investigating an incorrect component in a [blackduck_product_name] BOM, you need to determine whether the component was contributed by a detector, or by the [blackduck_signature_scanner_name]: On the [blackduck_product_name] Components tab for the project/version: Click on the "N Matches" link next to the component. The next screen lists the matches on the right side. Matches from the [blackduck_signature_scanner_name] have a filename in the Name column. Matches from detectors have an external ID (such as "org.hamcrest:hamcrest-core:1.3") in the Name column.
- For issues related to components missing from or or incorrectly categorized in the [blackduck_product_name] BOM: [solution_name] has a great deal of control over the production of BDIO files (use [--detect.diagnostic](../properties/configuration/debug.md#diagnostic-mode) to save these), but no control over how they are converted into a BOM by [blackduck_product_name]. A good first step is to determine whether the BDIO files produced are correct. If they are incorrect, the problem is related to what [solution_name] is doing. If they are correct, but the BOM is incorrect, the problem is related to what [blackduck_product_name] is doing. Similarly, [solution_name] is responsible for passing the correct arguments to the [blackduck_signature_scanner_name], but beyond that has no control over the results it produces.

## Spring Boot related issues

- [solution_name] is a Spring Boot application, and leverages Spring Boot to provide various mechanism to configure it through [property settings](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html). This flexibility comes with a risk: it's possible for [solution_name] to be influenced by files (application.properties, application.xml, etc.) that may exist in the directory from which [solution_name] is run that are intended for some other application. This can produce some strange results. If properties have unexpected values (see the [solution_name] log), this is a possibility worth considering. The best solution may be simply to run [solution_name] from a different (ideally empty) directory (use the --detect.source.path argument).
- Similarly, [solution_name] can be influenced by environment variables via the same Spring Boot mechanism, so it's worth checking the environment for variables that correspond to [solution_name] property names.
