## Version 10.2.0

### New features

* The scanCLI `detect.blackduck.signature.scanner.csv.archive` property has been added for generating and uploading CSV files to [bd_product_long] 2025.1.0 or later. If used in offline mode, the generated CSV files will be located in the [detect_product_short] run directory in the csv folder.
<note type="note">This feature is only available for intelligent persistence scans.</note>

### Changed features

* Use of the --detect.yarn.ignore.all.workspaces flag is not required for Yarn 4 projects, thus configuration parameters such as detect.yarn.dependency.types.excluded=NON_PRODUCTION can be employed.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-4447) - ID strings of detected Yarn project dependencies are now correctly formed. Related warning messages have been improved to identify entries in the yarn.lock file that have not been resolved through package.json files and could not be resolved with any standard NPM packages.
* (IDETECT-4533) - Resolved an issue with [detect_product_short] Gradle Native Inspector causing scans to hang indefinitely when submodule has the same name as the parent module.

### Dependency updates
