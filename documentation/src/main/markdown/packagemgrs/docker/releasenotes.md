# [docker_inspector_name] Release notes

## Version 10.1.0

### Changed features

* (IDETECT-3818) Added support to identify the BDIO namespace and origin as “oracle_linux” correctly when scanning Oracle Linux images.

### Dependency update

* Updated internal build dependencies for Image inspector library to 14.2.0 and Image Inspector Web Service to 5.1.0
* Upgraded Spring Boot to version 2.7.12 to resolve high severity [CVE-2023-20883](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20883)
* Upgraded SnakeYAML to version 2.0 to resolve critical severity [CVE-2022-1471](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471)

## Version 10.0.1

### Dependency update

* Updated internal build dependencies for Image inspector library to 14.1.4, Integration rest library to 10.3.6 and Image Inspector Web Service to 5.0.15

## Version 10.0.0

### Changed features

* Changed name from Black Duck Docker Inspector to Detect Docker Inspector.
* Changed the default value for imageinspector.service.log.length from 10,000 lines to 50,000 lines.

### Removed features

* Removed support for running Docker Inspector as a standalone utility (by executing blackduck-docker-inspector.sh or by executing the [docker_inspector_name] .jar). [docker_inspector_name]  must be invoked by running Synopsys Detect.
* Removed all [docker_inspector_name] properties involved in connecting to Black Duck ("blackduck.*"). Use [solution_name] properties instead.

## Version 9.4.3

### Dependency update

* Upgraded to Spring Boot version 2.6.6 / Spring version 5.3.18.

## Version 9.4.2

### Resolved issue

* (IDOCKER-764) Improved the clarity of the error message returned when the file provided via the *docker.tar* property does not have the supported (UNIX tar) format. 

## Version 9.4.1

### Documentation updates

* Added to the documentation the [organize components by layer](advanced.md#organizing-components-by-layer) feature (properties bdio.organize.components.by.layer and bdio.include.removed.components).

## Version 9.4.0

### New features

* Enhanced Black Duck Docker Inspector to provide information on relationships between linux package manager components (ie. discern direct from transitive dependencies).

### Changed features

* Deprecated properties associated with connection to Black Duck. This is a consequence of the transition away from supporting the use of Black Duck Docker Inspector as a standalone utility (as supposed to scanning via Detect).

## Version 9.3.1

### Resolved issue
* (IDETECT-2942) Resolved issue that caused Black Duck Docker Inspector to try to read the body of a bad response from image inspector services without checking the response's status code to make sure it was a successful request. Black Duck Docker Inspector now throws an exception if it receives a bad response.

### New feature
* Added support for Open Container Initiative (OCI) images provided to Black Duck Docker Inspector using the *docker.tar* property.

### Resolved issue
* (IDOCKER-742) Resolved an issue that caused Black Duck Docker Inspector to fail to find the target image (requested using the *docker.image.repo* property) in a multi-image .tar file when the *docker.image.repo* value includes the registry prefix (e.g. "docker.io/").

## Version 9.2.3

### Resolved issue
* (IDOCKER-736) Resolved an issue that could cause Black Duck Docker Inspector to use the wrong component namespace in BDIO, resulting in an empty BOM, for Oracle Linux images.

## Version 9.2.2
