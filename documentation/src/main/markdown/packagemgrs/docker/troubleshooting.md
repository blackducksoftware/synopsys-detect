# Troubleshooting overview

To troubleshoot issues with [docker_inspector_name], run with DEBUG logging enabled:

    --logging.level.com.synopsys=DEBUG

## Considerations when running on Windows

### Docker file sharing settings

[docker_inspector_name] requires the ability to share directories with the image inspector containers.
It shares a directory with image inspector containers by mounting it as a volume.
Configure your Docker settings to enable this file sharing by adding your home directory 
as a sharable directory on the Docker settings Resources > FILE SHARING screen.

The shared directories are created under the [solution_name] output directory
(controlled by [solution_name] *detect.output.path*).
If you change the location of the [solution_name] output directory be sure your Docker file sharing settings enable
sharing of that directory.

### Docker restrictions

Docker on Windows has restrictions that impact [docker_inspector_name]:

1. Docker can be configured to pull either Linux images, or Windows images.
You can see how your Docker installation is configured by looking
at the *OSType* value in the output of the *docker info* command.
If Docker is configured for Linux images, it cannot pull Windows images,
and vice versa. The command to change Docker's *OSType* value appears
in the Docker Desktop menu. Refer to Docker documentation for more information.
2. When pulling Windows images, Docker requires that the architecture of the
pulled image matches the architecture of your machine, and that the Windows version
of the pulled image is a close match to the Windows version of your machine.

## Problems and solutions

The following suggestions are related to specific problems.

### Problem: When directly invoking the .jar file, an error message displays "Malformed input or input contains unmappable characters."

Possible cause: Your local character encoding does not match the target container file system character encoding.

Solution/workaround: Set the character encoding to UTF-8 when invoking Java:
                     
    java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 ...
    
### Problem: Property values are set in unexpected ways.

Possible cause: [docker_inspector_name] is built using the Spring Boot application framework.
Spring Boot provides a variety of ways to set property values. This can produce unexpected results if,
for example, you have an environment variable whose name maps to a [docker_inspector_name] property name.
Refer to the
[Spring Boot documentation on external configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html)
for more details.

### Problem: The image inspector service cannot write to the mounted volume; SELinux is enabled.

When this happens, the following error may appear in the container log: 

    Exception thrown while getting image packages: Error inspecting image: [container_image_inspector_dir_path]/shared/run_.../output/..._containerfilesystem.tar.gz (Permission denied)
    ...
    Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /opt/blackduck/hub-imageinspector-ws/shared/run_.../output/..._containerfilesystem.tar.gz (Permission denied)

Possible cause: SELinux policy configuration.

Solution/workaround: Add the *svirt_sandbox_file_t* label to [docker_inspector_name]'s shared directory.
This enables the [docker_inspector_name] services running in Docker containers to write to it:
                     
    sudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /tmp/[project_name]-files/shared/

### Problem: The image inspector service cannot read from the mounted volume.

When this happens, the following error may appear in the container log: 

    Error inspecting image: [container_image_inspector_dir_path]/shared/run_.../{image}.tar (Permission denied)
    
Possible cause: The Linux umask value on the machine running [docker_inspector_name] is too restrictive.

Solution/workaround: Set the umask value to 022 when running [docker_inspector_name]. The cause could be a umask value
that prevents read access to the file, or read or execute access to the directory.
[docker_inspector_name] requires a umask value that does not remove read permissions from files 
and does not remove read or execute permissions from directories. For example, a umask value of 022 works.

### Problem: [docker_inspector_name] cannot perform Docker operations because the remote access port is not enabled on the Docker engine.

When this happens, the following error may appear in the log:

    Error inspecting image: java.io.IOException: Couldn't load native library
    Stack trace: javax.ws.rs.ProcessingException: java.io.IOException: Couldn't load native library

In versions of [docker_inspector_name] prior to 8.2.0, the logged error was:

    Error inspecting image: Could not initialize class org.newsclub.net.unix.NativeUnixSocket
    Stack trace: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.newsclub.net.unix.NativeUnixSocket

Possible cause: The TCP socket for remote access is not enabled on the Docker engine. For more information, refer to [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-socket-option).

Solution/workaround: Follow the instructions in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-socket-option) to
open the TCP port on the Docker engine.
