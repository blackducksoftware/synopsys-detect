[Detector properties](../properties/detectors/npm.md)

## Overview

[company_name] [solution_name] has the following NPM detectors:

* NPM package shrinkwrap detector
* NPM package lock detector
* NPM Package Json Parse detector
* NPM CLI detector

## Excluding dependency types
[company_name] [solution_name] offers the ability to exclude package manager specific dependency types from the BOM.
NPM dependency types can be filtered with the [detect.npm.dependency.types.excluded](../properties/detectors/npm.md#npm-dependency-types-excluded) property.

## NPM shrinkwrap

The NPM shrinkwrap detector uses the [npm-shrinkwrap.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/npm-shrinkwrap-json) file.

It is the same as a package-lock.json but is a publishable lockfile. Though both have high accuracy, [company_name] [solution_name] prefers shrinkwrap over package lock.

## NPM package lock

The NPM package lock runs when it finds a [package-lock.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-npm/package-lock-json.html) generated by NPM.

For accurate filtering with the *detect.npm.dependency.types.excluded* property, a package.json file is also required.

NPM automatically generates the package-lock.json after an *npm install* which should be run prior to scanning.

## NPM CLI detector

The NPM CLI detector requires a package.json and an npm executable.

It executes *npm ls -json*, and verifies that it succeeded by ensuring that no messages were written to
stderr, and that the exit code was 0. If both conditions are met, it parses the output for dependencies.

If *npm ls -json* does write messages to stderr (for example, lint messages) that you would like
[company_name] [solution_name] to ignore, you can silence errors by adding the --silent npm argument to the npm
command using [company_name] [solution_name] property --detect.npm.arguments.

This detector is only invoked if the more accurateNPM detectors (above) cannot be run.

## NPM Package Json Parse

This is the least accurate of the NPM detectors.

It requires and parses a package.json file.

The NPM Package Json Parse detectable is unable to discover transitive dependencies. 

When generating BDIO, the NPM Package Json Parse detectable uses version strings exactly as it finds them in package.json.
Components whose versions are specified in the package.json using wildcards ("^", etc.) will not match components in the KB
due to the wildcards.
