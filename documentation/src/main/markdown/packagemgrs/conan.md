[Detector properties](../properties/detectors/conan.md)

## Overview

[company_name] [solution_name] has two strategies for identifying components in Conan projects:

* Conan CLI output parsing
* Conan Lockfile parsing

## Conan detector requirements

[company_name] [solution_name] will run a Conan Detector if either of the following is true:

* [company_name] [solution_name] finds or is provided via the *detect.conan.lockfile.path* property, a Conan lockfile. If no lockfile is provided, [company_name] [solution_name] looks for a file named *conan.lock*. In this case, the Conan Lockfile detector runs and discovers dependency details using the contents of the Conan lockfile. For Conan version 1.x, the Conan Lockfile detector is attempted first due to the additional information (package revisions) that may be provided by lockfiles. For Conan version 2.x, Conan CLI detector is attempted first as a Conan 2.x lockfile is a flat list of all components rather than a graph.
* [company_name] [solution_name] finds a file named *conanfile.txt* or *conanfile.py*. In this case, a Conan CLI detector runs and discovers dependency details by running the *conan info* or *conan graph info* command on the Conan project and parsing the output.

For Conan 1.x, in order for [company_name] [solution_name] to generate dependency details that will reliably match components
in the [blackduck_kb], the Conan revisions feature must be enabled on the Conan project.
The Conan command *conan config get general.revisions_enabled* must produce a value of "True"
*and* this value must not be overridden by the environment variable CONAN_REVISIONS_ENABLED.

## Conan detector usage

When using a Conan CLI detector, be sure to use the *detect.conan.arguments* property to provide any additional arguments (profile settings, etc.) that the *conan info* or *conan graph info* commands need to produce accurate results.

## [blackduck_kb] external ID generation

By default (property *detect.conan.attempt.package.revision.match* is set to false), the Conan detectors use the following dependency details to match components in the [blackduck_kb]:

* name
* version
* user (defaults to "_")
* channel (defaults to "_")
* recipe_revision

For example, here is a Conan 1.x conan.lock file entry for a component (zlib):
```
   "2": {
    "ref": "zlib/1.2.11#1a67b713610ae745694aa4df1725451d",
    "options": "fPIC=True\nminizip=False\nshared=False",
    "package_id": "d50a0d523d98c15bb147b18fa7d203887c38be8b",
    "prev": "da65bb160c07195dba18afb91259050d",
    "context": "host"
   },
```

If you are using a Conan CLI detector instead of the Conan Lockfile detector, this data is found in the output of the `conan info` or `conan graph info` command
instead of the conan.lock file.

The format of the Conan "ref" field is: `<name>/<version>@<user>/<channel>#<recipe_revision>`

In the zlib example:

* name=zlib
* version=1.2.11
* user=_ (by default)
* channel=_ (by default)
* recipe_revision=1a67b713610ae745694aa4df1725451d

[company_name] [solution_name] constructs a [blackduck_kb] external ID for namespace "conan" using these fields as follows:
```
<name>/<version>@<user>/<channel>#<recipe_revision>
```

## Package revision matching

For situations when package ID and package revision information is available
[company_name] [solution_name] has an alternative mode, package revision matching, that includes
the package ID and package revision in the [blackduck_kb] external IDs that it constructs (in addition to the fields described above).
(Package revision is provided by Conan 1.x lockfiles when the Conan revisions feature is enabled and by Conan 2.x *conan graph info* command,
but it is never provided by the Conan 2.x *conan info* command, so this only affects the Conan Lockfile detector.)
To enable package revision matching, set property *detect.conan.attempt.package.revision.match* to true.


In this scenario, [company_name] [solution_name] constructs a [blackduck_kb] external ID for namespace "conan" as follows:
```
<name>/<version>@<user>/<channel>#<recipe_revision>:<package_id>#<package_revision>
```

For the zlib example above the two additional fields used in the KB external ID would be:

* package_id=d50a0d523d98c15bb147b18fa7d203887c38be8b
* package_revision=da65bb160c07195dba18afb91259050d

## Conan Detector Precedence

If a conanfile.txt or conanfile.py is found and Conan 2.x is in use, a Conan CLI detector will run.

As a following attempt, if a Conan lockfile (conan.lock) is found or provided, the Conan Lockfile detector will run.

Finally, if a conanfile.txt or conanfile.py is found and Conan 1.x is in use, a Conan CLI detector will run.

## Customized user/channel values

Some Conan users use modified versions of Open Source packages with custom user/channel values. These modified components will not match components in the [blackduck_kb].
The [blackduck_kb] requires a match on user and channel.
