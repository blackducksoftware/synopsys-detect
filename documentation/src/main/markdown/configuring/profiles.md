# Switching between multiple profiles

A profile is, in effect, a set of pre-defined properties. You select the profile (property settings)
you want when you run [solution_name].

## Creating a profile

To define a set of properties for a profile, create a configuration file named *application-{profilename}.properties*
or *application-{profilename}.yml* in the current working directory, or in a subdirectory named *config*.
Populate it with property assignments as previously described.

## Selecting a profile on the command line

To select one or more profiles on the [solution_name] command line, assign the the comma-separated list of profiles
to the Spring Boot property *spring.profiles.active*:
```
bash <(curl -s -L https://detect.synopsys.com/detect8.sh) --spring.profiles.active={profilename}
```

This capability is provided by Spring Boot. For more information, refer to
[Spring Boot's profile mechanism](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.5/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-profiles).
