* In Azure DevOps, click **Queue**, and your task is executed on the next available build agent.
* If your task configuration is incomplete, a red status message of *Some settings need your attention* displays below **Run [detect_product_short] for your build**.
   * Missing required settings display in red in the **[detect_product_short]** panel.
