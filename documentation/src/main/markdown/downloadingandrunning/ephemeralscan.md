# Ephemeral Scan LCA

Ephemeral Scan, or Ephemeral Scan Mode, is a new way of running [solution_name] with [blackduck_product_name]. This mode is designed to be as fast as possible and does not persist any data on [blackduck_product_name]. Ephemeral Scan Mode has a unique set of restrictions, mode of configuration and set of results.  It is similar to Rapid Scan Mode however it differs in that it supports usage of the SIGNATURE_SCAN tool.  Ephemeral Scan allows non-persistent signature scans to be performed.

Enable this feature by adding [--detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL](../properties/configuration/blackduck-server.md#detect-scan-mode-advanced) to a run of Detect.

## Requirements and Limitations

 * Ephemeral scanning is available under [blackduck_product_name] “Limited Customer Availability (LCA)”.
 * Must be running [blackduck_product_name] 2022.10.0 or greater using the hosted KB.
 * Have Match as a Service (MaaS) enabled within [blackduck_product_name], a feature which will be available with the [blackduck_product_name] 2022.10.0 release.
 * A limited subset of Tools can be run.
    * The currently supported tools are: DETECTOR, BAZEL, SIGNATURE_SCAN and DOCKER.
    * The EPHEMERAL Signature Scan will not persist on Black Duck. 
    * All other tools are disabled when running in Ephemeral Scan mode.
 * Ephemeral Scan and non-persistent SIGNATURE_SCAN
    * To perform a non-persistent Signature Scan in Ephemeral mode, SIGNATURE_SCAN must be included within --detect.tools.
    * Permitted tools omitted from the detect.tools list will not be run.
 * Ephemeral Scan requires Black Duck policies. 
    * Ephemeral Scan only reports components that violate policies. 
    * If no policies are violated or there are no defined policies, then no components are returned.
 * Ephemeral Scan does not support ```detect.policy.check.fail.on.severities```
    * [solution_name] will fail with FAILURE_POLICY_VIOLATION if any component violates Black Duck polices with a CRITICAL or BLOCKER severity. 
    * See the Black Duck documentation for a list of policy conditions that are supported by Ephemeral Scan. 
 * Ephemeral Scan does not support ```detect.policy.check.fail.on.names```
 * Ephemeral Scan cannot create a Risk or Notices report.
 * Ephemeral Scan will not create a Project or Version on Black Duck.
 * Ephemeral Scan when running SIGNATURE_SCAN requires communication with Black Duck.
 
## Invocation
 * To invoke non-persistent (Rapid/Ephemeral) signature scan only
    * --detect.tools=SIGNATURE_SCAN --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
 * To invoke Rapid/Ephemeral package manager scans
    * --detect.tools=DETECTOR --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=DETECTOR --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=RAPID
    * --detect.tools=BAZEL --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=RAPID
    * --detect.tools=BAZEL --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=DOCKER --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=DOCKER --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=RAPID
    * --detect.target.type=IMAGE --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=RAPID
    * --detect.target.type=IMAGE --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
 * To invoke combined Rapid/Ephemeral scans (non-exhaustive list):
    * --detect.tools=DETECTOR,SIGNATURE_SCAN --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=DETECTOR,SIGNATURE_SCAN,DOCKER --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=BAZEL,SIGNATURE_SCAN --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=DETECTOR,DOCKER --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=RAPID

## Results

Unlike persistent scans, no data is stored on Black Duck and all scans are done transiently. These scans are primarily intended to be fast, although the SIGNATURE_SCAN can take some time as communication with Black Duck is a requirement.

The results are saved to a json file named 'name_version_BlackDuck_DeveloperMode_Result.json' in the Scan Output directory, where name and version are the project's name and version.

**NOTE:**
 * The format of this results file is dependent on Black Duck and in the future, different versions of Black Duck may produce a different file format.

The results are also printed in the logs:
